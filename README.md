## If you want to explore raw data from the parquet files

You'll need the following extensions installed in VS Code, installed in the devcontainer (not needed to for compilation or execution of the application).

Data Wrangler (for parquet)

Python extension (required by Data Wrangler for parquet)

Jupyter extension (required by Data Wrangler for parquet)

If Data Wangler is ever switched away from, Python and Juptyer extensions should be removed if not being used by other extensions.
