# The Web UI

The goal of the web ui is be lightweight yet useful in terms of its features to a typical user rendering price charting data. There is to be no or limited business logic withing this layer as the goal of the project is to have all intense calculations and analysis done in the Go layer, meaning the UI can be swapped around with minimal difference in features.

Plotly is in the initial choice for rendering, installed locally into the container and not fetched via a cdn to avoid network issues interfering with workflows. A full react application was considered too, mainly for unit testing, but opted against at this time as I deem it overkill for a layer with so little actual business logic.
