# React UI: 2026 Jan 25

## Context

The application was originally built using a simple plotly.js in html implementation of a web ui just to see if data was being calculated correctly at all. It worked, and helped uncover a few data issues.

## The problem

The plotly.js / html implementation is proving hard to customize and scale. I dont need a massively complex web UI, as its not the main value of the application (the data it produces is) but I need a little more ability to move, customize, and test things with unit tests.

## React port

Im going to still use plotly but the react version and rebuild the web ui in react with ESLINT and Jest to solve the issue of adding things like chart titles, left side bar controls, plot legends, etc in a flexible manner that can increase in complexity gradually over time.
